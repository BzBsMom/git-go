  <h2>Repos</h2>
  <p>The .git foulder -is- the repo</p>
  <p>Can e-mail or copy it a USB to share the repo</p>
  <p>Different from some other source control which use a server as the repo
  This is why it is called distributed - any copy of the git repo is the ‘official’ repo</p>
  <p>Allows offline work - we can commit, merge, etc changes and it is all stored in .git without needing to connect to a server</p>
