# git-go

This is a sample project for learning git

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application that is deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and should be accessible [here](https://Zulu-Inuoe.github.io/git-go)

## Dev Environment

```sh
npm install
```
then run the React development server via
```sh
npm run start

## Markdown
May as well learn a sprinkle of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) while you're here!

Markdown is a simple way of creating documents with features such as
- Bulleted lists
- Links like this one to [Google](https://www.google.com/)
- Miscelaneous text markup like **Bold**, *Italized*
- Quote blocks:
> It is said that text maketh documentation
- Code blocks:
```js
let some_javascript_code = "let some_javascript_code = ";
console.log(some_javascript_code);
```
- Inline images: ![](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/0/c/5/600_489229349.jpeg)

Because it's text-based, it's easy to properly version in source control tools because you can actually 'diff' two versions to track changes.

Markdown has become a popular way of at the very least having a README.md file in your repo which describes and documents it in some way.
